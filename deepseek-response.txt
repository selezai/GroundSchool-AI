### Question 1: VOR Signal Characteristics  
**Question:** What is the frequency range in which VOR ground stations operate?  
A) 88.0 to 107.9 MHz  
B) 108.0 to 117.95 MHz  
C) 118.0 to 136.975 MHz  
D) 960 to 1215 MHz  

**Correct Answer:** B) 108.0 to 117.95 MHz  
**Explanation:** According to the study material, VOR ground stations operate in the frequency range of 108.0 to 117.95 MHz. This is a key characteristic of VOR navigation systems.

A) Terminal VOR (TVOR)  
B) Low-altitude VOR  
C) High-altitude VOR  
D) Military TACAN

### Question 3: VOR Navigation Techniques  
**Question:** What does each dot on the Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) represent in terms of lateral deviation from the selected course?  
A) 1 degree  
B) 2 degrees  
C) 5 degrees  
D) 10 degrees  

**Correct Answer:** B) 2 degrees  
**Explanation:** The study material states that each dot on the CDI represents 2 degrees of lateral deviation, with a full-scale deflection equivalent to 10 degrees off course.

### Question 4: GPS Navigation Systems  
**Question:** What is the minimum number of satellites required for RAIM to verify the integrity of GPS signals during approach procedures?  
A) 3  
B) 4  
C) 5  
D) 6  

**Correct Answer:** C) 5  
**Explanation:** The study material explains that RAIM must verify the availability of at least 5 satellites with good geometry to ensure the integrity of GPS signals for approach procedures.

### Question 5: Inertial Navigation Systems  
**Question:** What is the typical drift rate for modern Ring Laser Gyro (RLG)-based Inertial Navigation Systems (INS)?  
A) 0.01-0.05 nautical miles per hour  
B) 0.1-0.5 nautical miles per hour  
C) 1-2 nautical miles per hour  
D) 5-10 nautical miles per hour  

**Correct Answer:** B) 0.1-0.5 nautical miles per hour  
**Explanation:** The study material specifies that modern RLG-based INS systems have typical drift rates of 0.1-0.5 nautical miles per hour due to integration errors.
