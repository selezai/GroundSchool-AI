Here are 5 multiple-choice questions based on the provided study material:

---

### Question 1:  
**What is the primary function of ailerons in an aircraft's flight control system?**  
A. To control pitch around the lateral axis  
B. To control roll around the longitudinal axis  
C. To control yaw around the vertical axis  
D. To improve lift during takeoff and landing  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Ailerons are primary flight controls that control roll, which is the movement of the aircraft around its longitudinal axis.

### Question 2:  
**Which of the following is NOT a primary flight control?**  
A. Ailerons  
B. Elevators  
C. Rudder  
D. Flaps  

**Correct Answer:** D  
**Explanation:** Flaps are secondary flight controls used to improve aircraft performance, while ailerons, elevators, and rudder are primary flight controls.

### Question 3:  
**What is the primary purpose of secondary flight controls?**  
A. To control the aircraft's basic movements (roll, pitch, and yaw)  
B. To improve performance characteristics or relieve excessive control forces  
C. To replace primary flight controls in case of failure  
D. To provide navigation assistance  

**Correct Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Secondary flight controls, such as flaps, slats, spoilers, and trim systems, are used to enhance performance or reduce control forces, not to control basic movements.  

---

### Question 4:  
**Which secondary flight control is used to increase lift during takeoff and landing?**  
A. Spoilers  
B. Trim systems  
C. Flaps  
D. Rudder  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** Flaps are secondary flight controls that extend to increase the wing's surface area, thereby increasing lift during takeoff and landing.

### Question 5:  
**What axis does the rudder control movement around?**  
A. Longitudinal axis  
B. Lateral axis  
C. Vertical axis  
D. Horizontal axis  

**Correct Answer:** C  
**Explanation:** The rudder is a primary flight control that controls yaw, which is the movement of the aircraft around its vertical axis.

These questions test the understanding of primary and secondary flight controls and their specific functions as outlined in the study material.
