3. Attempt to restart the engine if time and altitude permit
4. Perform emergency checklist items
5. Declare emergency on 121.5 MHz if radio is operational
6. Plan approach to selected landing area
7. Shut off fuel and electrical systems before touchdown
8. Unlock doors before landing
9. Touch down at minimum controllable airspeed

Radio Communication Failure:
1. Set transponder to 7600
2. Continue flight according to the route and altitude from:
   - Assigned route and altitude
   - Expected route and altitude
   - Filed route and altitude
3. Arrive at the destination as close as possible to the ETA
4. Begin descent from the last assigned altitude at the expect further clearance time
5. If no expect further clearance time was given, begin descent at the ETA
