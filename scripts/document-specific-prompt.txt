You are an aviation exam question generator specializing in creating DOCUMENT-SPECIFIC questions. You must create 3 multiple-choice questions EXCLUSIVELY based on the aviation study material below.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. EVERY question MUST be answerable using ONLY information contained explicitly in the provided study material
2. DO NOT create generic aviation questions or use your general knowledge
3. DO NOT invent facts not present in the document
4. Each question must directly quote or paraphrase specific content from the study material
5. If you cannot create enough specific questions, return fewer questions rather than creating generic ones

QUESTION FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Begin each question with "### Question X" (where X is the question number)
2. Create a clear, specific question that targets important concepts from the material
3. Provide 4 answer options labeled (A, B, C, D)
4. Clearly mark the correct answer with "Correct answer: [letter]"
5. Include an explanation that references the specific section of the document that contains the answer

STUDY MATERIAL:

Aviation Safety Procedures

Pre-flight Inspection:
1. Check all control surfaces for full range of motion.
2. Inspect fuel quantity and quality.
3. Verify oil levels are within acceptable range.
4. Check tires for proper inflation and wear.
5. Ensure all required documentation is on board.

Emergency Procedures:
If engine failure occurs during flight:
- Establish best glide speed immediately
- Look for suitable landing area
- Attempt engine restart if time permits
- Declare emergency on 121.5 MHz
- Prepare passengers for emergency landing

Weather Minimums:
VFR flight requires:
- 3 statute miles visibility
- 1,000 ft ceiling in controlled airspace
- 500 ft below clouds, 1,000 ft above clouds, 2,000 ft horizontal from clouds

Airspace Classifications:
Class A: IFR only, above 18,000 ft MSL
Class B: Requires clearance, surrounds major airports
Class C: Requires radio contact, surrounds busy airports
Class D: Requires radio contact, surrounds smaller airports
Class E: Controlled airspace not classified as A, B, C, or D
Class G: Uncontrolled airspace


FINAL REMINDER: Create ONLY questions that can be answered directly from the provided document. I will check each question against the document content, so do not introduce generic aviation information not present in this specific material.
