### Question 1  
**What does the QNH setting on a pressure altimeter display?**  
A. Height above the airfield  
B. Altitude above mean sea level  
C. Height above the WGS-84 ellipsoid  
D. Altitude above the transition altitude  

**Correct answer: B**  
**Explanation:** The QNH setting on a pressure altimeter displays altitude above mean sea level (MSL), as stated in the study material under "Pressure Altimeter."

### Question 2  
**Which type of altimeter is critical for approaches and landings in low visibility conditions?**  
A. Pressure Altimeter  
B. Radio Altimeter  
C. GPS Altitude  
D. Barometric Altimeter  

**Correct answer: B**  
**Explanation:** The radio altimeter is specifically mentioned as critical for approaches and landings in low visibility, particularly for Category II and III approaches.

### Question 3  
**What is the standard pressure setting used for flight levels above the transition altitude?**  
A. QNH  
B. QFE  
C. 29.92 inHg or 1013.2 hPa  
D. Local geoid height  

**Correct answer: C**  
**Explanation:** The standard pressure setting for flight levels above the transition altitude is 29.92 inHg or 1013.2 hPa, as noted in the "Pressure Altimeter" section.

### Question 4  
**What is the primary cause of temperature error in altimeter readings?**  
A. Mechanical inaccuracies in the instrument  
B. Delay in instrument response during climbs and descents  
C. Altimeter overreading in colder than standard air  
D. Incorrect QNH setting  

**Correct answer: C**  
**Explanation:** Temperature error occurs when the altimeter overreads in colder than standard air, as described by the phrase "High to low, look out below" in the "Altimeter Errors" section.

### Question 5  
**What is the approximate altitude error caused by a 1 hPa error in the QNH setting?**  
A. 10 feet  
B. 20 feet  
C. 30 feet  
D. 40 feet  

**Correct answer: C**  
**Explanation:** A 1 hPa error in the QNH setting results in an approximate altitude error of 30 feet, as stated in the "Altimeter Errors" section.
