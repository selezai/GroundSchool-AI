## Chapter 1: VOR Navigation Principles

### 1.1 Introduction to VOR Navigation
Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) is a type of radio navigation system for aircraft. VOR ground stations transmit signals that aircraft can receive to determine their position relative to the station. The VOR system operates in the 108.0 to 117.95 MHz frequency band.

### 1.2 VOR Signal Characteristics
VOR stations emit two signals: a reference phase signal that is constant in all directions, and a variable phase signal that rotates at 30 Hz. The phase difference between these signals determines the aircraft's radial from the station. A radial is defined as a line extending from the VOR station in a specific direction, expressed in magnetic degrees from the station (000° to 359°).

### 1.3 Types of VOR Stations
There are several types of VOR stations:
- Terminal VOR (TVOR): Range of 25 nautical miles, typically located near airports
- Low-altitude VOR: Range of 40 nautical miles, covers altitudes up to 18,000 feet
- High-altitude VOR: Range of 130 nautical miles, covers altitudes up to 45,000 feet
- Military TACAN: Combined with civilian VOR to create VORTAC stations

### 1.4 VOR Navigation Techniques
Pilots use VOR indications to:
1. Fly directly to a station (by centering the CDI needle)
2. Fly along a specific radial to or from a station
3. Determine their position by using intersecting radials from two different stations
4. Hold over a station using specific entry procedures

The course deviation indicator (CDI) displays lateral deviation from the selected course. Each dot on the CDI represents 2 degrees of deviation, with a full-scale deflection equivalent to 10 degrees off course.

## Chapter 2: GPS Navigation Systems

### 2.1 GPS Principles and Operation
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation system consisting of 24 operational satellites in six orbital planes. Each satellite transmits precise time and orbital information. GPS receivers calculate position by measuring the time difference of signals from multiple satellites.

### 2.2 WAAS and RAIM
Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) enhances the accuracy of GPS by providing correction signals. It enables approach procedures with vertical guidance (APV) down to 200-foot decision heights.

Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) is a technology developed to assess the integrity of GPS signals. For approach procedures, RAIM must verify the availability of at least 5 satellites with good geometry.

### 2.3 GPS Approach Categories
- LPV (Localizer Performance with Vertical guidance): Similar to ILS, with a 200-foot decision height
- LNAV/VNAV (Lateral Navigation/Vertical Navigation): 350-foot minimum decision height
- LNAV (Lateral Navigation): Non-precision approach with MDA instead of DH
- LP (Localizer Performance): Similar to localizer-only approach

The maximum permitted lateral deviation on an LPV approach is 700 feet at the decision height.

## Chapter 3: Inertial Navigation Systems

### 3.1 Principles of Inertial Navigation
Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) use accelerometers and gyroscopes to continuously calculate position, orientation, and velocity without external references. Modern aircraft use Ring Laser Gyros (RLG) which detect rotation by measuring the difference in path length between two counter-rotating laser beams.

### 3.2 INS Drift Characteristics
INS accuracy degrades over time due to integration errors, a phenomenon known as "drift." Typical drift rates for modern RLG-based systems are 0.1-0.5 nautical miles per hour. For trans-oceanic flights, the maximum permitted INS drift is 2 nautical miles per hour.

### 3.3 Integration with Other Systems
Most modern aircraft use a hybrid navigation approach where INS is integrated with GPS and other radio navigation systems to provide:
- Continued navigation during GPS outages
- Filtering of GPS position jumps
- Improved update rates for flight control systems

Boeing 787 aircraft implement triple-redundant INS with a maximum drift specification of 0.1 nautical miles per hour.
